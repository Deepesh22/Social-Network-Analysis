Fatman Model : 
1. A model to depict the effect of homophily, social influence, closure property in a network of 100 people with different BMI(body mass index).
2. We used 5 foci namely Gym, eatout, movie, karate, yoga and randomly connected each person to any one of focii initially.
3. Next we introduced homophily, social influence, closure property in network.
 Homophily : Homophily refers to the tendency for people to have (non-negative) ties with people who are similar 
               to themselves in socially significant ways (here BMI).
 Closure : 
            foci closure : people with similar interest tend to become friend with each other.
            triadic closure : people having common friend tend to become friend with each other.
            membership closure : people of same community (club, gym etc) to become friend with each other.
 Social Influence : Social influence is the change in behavior that one person causes in another, intentionally 
                      or unintentionally, as a result of the way the changed person perceives themselves in relationship 
                      to the influencer, other people and society in general.

4. We observed that Number of obese people increase around the eatout point and movie because of the above 
   properties majorly Social Influence since Homophily and closure are resposible for defining people we hang out with but Social
   Influence is the change in behaviour because of it.
